# ProBoard App
This is the public facing repo for the ProBoard App. This is not a open source app and so the files are not here. Although if you have any issues or questions, please use the Issues tab above.

This app was created in response to a need to display a scoreboard with ProPresentor. Simply use the scoreboard link and add as a full screen webpage to a slide in your presention. Or you can use with any computer and make the scoreboard fullscreen on a second display.
